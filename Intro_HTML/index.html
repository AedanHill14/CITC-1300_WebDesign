<h2>An Ode To Cheese</h2>
<p>Oh, dear cheese, I crave your creamy texture! How luscious your flavor! How glorious your luster! There is no end to your potential. None other remains as versatile as thee. All foods you grace with your heavenly flavor are are monumentally amplified. Oh, if I might drown in a river of your melty goodness I would surely die a happy man!</p>

<h3>How Cheese Is Made</h3>

<p>Cheese is made by bringing milk in a cheese vat to a temperature required to promote the growth of the bacteria that feed on lactose and thus ferment the lactose into lactic acid. During the fermentation process, once sufficient lactic acid has been developed, rennet is added to cause the casein to precipitate. As the curd is formed, milk fat is trapped in a casein matrix. After adding the rennet, the cheese milk is left to form curds over a period of time. Once the cheese curd is judged to be ready, the cheese whey must be released. It is necessary to remove most of the water (whey) from the cheese milk, and hence cheese curd, to make a partial dehydration of the curd. In making Cheddar (or many other hard cheeses) the curd is cut into small cubes and the temperature is raised to approximately 102 °F to scald the curd particles. The curd is cut using long, blunt knives and 'blocked' (stacked, cut and turned) by the cheesemaker to promote the release of cheese whey in a process known as 'cheddaring'. During this process the acidity of the curd increases to a desired level. The curd is then milled into ribbon shaped pieces and salt is mixed into it to arrest acid development. The salted green cheese curd is put into cheese moulds lined with cheesecloths and pressed overnight to allow the curd particles to bind together. The pressed blocks of cheese are then removed from the cheese moulds and are either bound with muslin-like cloth, or waxed or vacuum packed in plastic bags to be stored for maturation.</p>
