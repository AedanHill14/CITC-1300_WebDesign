        <p>Breaking Benjamin has released 8 albums since they were formed in 2002. Saturate, their first album released in 2002, peaked at No. 136 on the Billboard 200. Their second album, We Are Not Alone (2004), peaked at No. 20 on that same list. Their single "So Cold," which was featured on that album, went platinum in 2015, and also peaked at No. 2 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart. Their third and most famous album, Phobia (2006), peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard, and went gold only two months after release, later becoming platinum in 2009 and double platinum in 2015. Its lead single "The Diary of Jane" became the fastest single ever added to radio playlists in the history of Hollywood Records. Their fourth album, Dear Agony (2009), peaked at No. 4 on the billboard. The album went gold in 2010, and platinum in 2015. Its lead single "I Will Not Bow" reached No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart. </p>
        <p>After the release of "Dear Agony," lead singer Benjamin Burnley had several health issues, and the band went on an indefinite hiatus. During that hiatus, the other members of the band put together a fifth album, Shallow Bay (2011), without Benjamin's permission. The album was a compilation of all the band's most popular songs along with a few unreleased songs and B-sides. Benjamin did not approve and believed it did not match his standards. This caused a legal fallout, ending with Benjamin having to find all new band members. With an all new lineup, Breaking Benjamin released their fifth album in 2015, Dark Before Dawn, which peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 within a week, and went gold in 2016. Its lead single "Failure" spent 9 weeks at No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart. The band's sixth album, Ember (2018), debuted at No. 2 on the billboard and the single "Red Cold River" peaked at No. 2 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart and No. 5 on the Hot Rock Songs chart. Their most recent album, Aurora (2020), is a compilation of acoustic remasters of their most popular songs, featuring various other singers on some songs, as well as a new single, "Far Away," featuring Scooter Ward.  </p>
