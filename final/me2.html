        <h2>Story Summary</h2>
        <p>Mass Effect 2, begins with Commander Shepard's apparent death during an attack by a mysterious alien vessel. However, Shepard is resurrected two years later by the pro-human organization Cerberus, led by the Illusive Man, and tasked with investigating the disappearance of entire human colonies. The threat is revealed to be the Collectors, an enigmatic species working on behalf of the Reapers to abduct humans for a dark and unknown purpose. Reluctantly allied with Cerberus, who has a track record of radical behavior, Shepard sets out to uncover the truth behind these abductions.</p>
        <p>To stop the Collectors, Shepard assembles a highly specialized team of operatives from across the galaxy — assassins, scientists, mercenaries, and more — each with their own personal struggles that must be resolved to earn their loyalty. The mission ultimately leads through the Omega-4 Relay, a one-way passage to the Collectors' base. In a climactic “suicide mission,” the survival of the entire squad depends on the player's decisions and preparation. Shepard destroys the Collector base, striking a major blow against the Reapers, but learns that their full-scale invasion is drawing closer, setting the stage for the final chapter of the trilogy.</p>
        <h3>Gameplay</h3>

Cover is easier to navigate, weapons handle better and have more variety, Submachine Guns are added, abilities are more readily available with faster cooldowns, and it offers the largest cast of characters in the whole series.</p>
        <p>Decision making plays a much larger part in this game, with your squadmate's lives held directly in your hands. If you make the right choices and take the time to do things right, it really is possible to save everyone. Mass Effect 2 also adds interrupt events, giving you the option to interrupt a conversation or cutscene to perform an action, either Paragon or Renegade, which is Mass Effect's reputation system throghout the series. A paragon action might include giving healing to an injured soldier, or standing up for someone being talked down on, while a renegade action usually includes resorting to violence or strongly putting down someone.</p>
        <p>Mass Effect 2 changes the way upgrades work, now requiring resources found by probing planets. You can upgrade armor, weapons, powers, or even the Normandy in the ship's lab. The Normandy upgrades in particular are important for the final mission and can save you or your crewmate's lives.</p>
        <h3>World</h3>
        <p>Mass Effect 2 furhter expands the reach of the world, now including the "Terminus Systems" which is like the Wild West of the Milky Way galaxy. The game also expands on the history of the Reapers, shedding some light on these mysterious antagonists. </p>
