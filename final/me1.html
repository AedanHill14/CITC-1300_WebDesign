        <h2>Story Summary</h2>
        <p>The first Mass Effect game follows Commander Shepard, a human soldier who becomes the first of their species to earn the elite Spectre status. After a mission on Eden Prime reveals the betrayal of Spectre agent Saren, Shepard learns he is working to unleash the Reapers—ancient, machine-like beings that eradicate all advanced life in the galaxy every 50,000 years. Given authority to stop him, Shepard travels across the galaxy, uncovering clues about the Reapers while building a diverse squad of allies whose loyalty and trust depend on player choices</p>
        <p>As Shepard pieces together the truth, it becomes clear that Saren believes cooperation with the Reapers is the only way to ensure survival. The conflict culminates in a battle at the Citadel, where Shepard defeats Saren and destroys Sovereign, a Reaper vanguard. Though the immediate threat is stopped, the larger danger remains, ending the game on a tense note and setting up the broader war that defines the rest of the trilogy.</p>       
        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p>Being the first game in the series, and being released in 2007, Mass Effect has some of the weakest gameplay in the series. However, it lays a vital groundwork that later games build off of and improve drastically. Combat is simple but fun, involving many different weapons, class-specific abilities, a cover system, and varying enemy types.</p>
        <p>Gameplay also involves dialogue choices which pop up on screen during conversations, which can usually affect the story, sometimes even affecting later games. This aspect of gameplay made Mass Effect very unique for its time, and allows the player to form their own story for themselves.</p>
        <p>One defining aspect of the Mass Effect series is the individuality given to each player. You are allowed to pick between a male or female Commander Shepard, and you can customize each one to your liking or use the preset look. Picking either choice does not affect story, only personal preference (though it does affect some availability for romances).</p>
        <h3>World</h3>
        <p>Because it is the first game in the series, Mass Effect is responsible for setting up the entire universe that takes place throughout the series. There are many different alien races spanning the Milky Way galaxy - Asari, Turians, Krogans, Salarians, Quarians, Volus, Hanar, Elcor, and of course Humans, just to name a few. There is an entire history for each race, and each has their own conflicts with one another. This history can be discovered through conversations or by reading the Codex, which outlines the expansive world Mass Effect has to offer. Though the world is expansive, the first game only takes place in Citadel Systems, which is because as a Spectre, Shepard is under their jurisdiction.</p>
