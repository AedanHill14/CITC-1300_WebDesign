        <h2>Story Summary</h2>
        <p>Mass Effect: Andromeda shifts the story away from the Reaper War and into a fresh frontier. Set hundreds of years after the original trilogy, the game follows either Scott or Sara Ryder, a Pathfinder tasked with finding habitable worlds for the Andromeda Initiative — a multi-species effort to establish new homes in the Andromeda galaxy. However, the mission quickly goes wrong as the initiative encounters hostile alien forces known as the Kett and discovers that many of the “golden worlds” are dangerously unstable. </p>
        <p>As Ryder steps into the unexpected role of Pathfinder, they must unite scattered colonies, uncover the secrets of the advanced Remnant technology, and confront the Kett's attempts to dominate and forcibly transform other species. Alongside a new crew of companions, Ryder works to make Andromeda viable for settlement. The story centers less on galactic extinction and more on exploration, survival, and carving out hope in unfamiliar territory — closing on the promise of building something new rather than simply surviving the end of something old.</p>
        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p>Gameplay in Mass Effect Andromeda feels very different from what we've been used to in the original trilogy. It is more open, fast paced, and versatile. Ryder can now change classes on the go with loudouts, where you can mix and match different abilities from each class. There is also a large variety of armor and weapons, both new and old to the series, now even including new melee weapons, which is never before seen in the series.</p>
        <p>Mass Effect Andromeda focuses heavily on exploration. While the main story missions still focus on a linear design, outside of missions, it is a very open world with many different side quests and tasks to discover. On each viable planet, you can find ruins and devices to terraform the planet and make it open for colonization. Each planet can then be tailored to produce research points for a certain alignment which can drastically help with upgrades.</p>
        <p>This game has less decision making than previous games in the series, but it more than makes up for it in story and world-building. Most decision making is less of a moral dilemma like the previous games and more like a personality quiz. Each option has pros and cons, and there are not as many lasting side-effects of these choices.</p>
        <h3>World</h3>
        <p>Hence the name, Mass Effect Andromeda takes place in the Andromeda galaxy, thus a whole new opportunity for world building is available. New species, comflicts, worlds, and enemies are introduced. However, some aspects that the previous games had, like the impending doom of the reaper invasion and the constant war, are not present, which allows for a more relaxed experience, but can also mean less fulfillment after beating the game, depending on what you may expect.</p>
