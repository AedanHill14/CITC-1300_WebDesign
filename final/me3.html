        <h2>Story Summary</h2>
        <p>In Mass Effect 3, the Reapers are here. The game opens with the Reapers launching a full-scale invasion of Earth and the rest of the galaxy. With civilization collapsing, Commander Shepard is tasked with uniting long-divided species to mount a final defense. Traveling from world to world, Shepard forges fragile alliances, resolving long-standing conflicts like the war between the quarians and the geth and addressing the genophage that has plagued the krogan, while gathering military strength for a final stand.</p>
        <p>As the war escalates, Shepard uncovers plans for the Crucible, a superweapon designed to end the Reaper threat once and for all. The game builds toward a massive assault on Earth, where the Crucible is deployed at the Citadel. In the final moments, Shepard is confronted with a choice that determines the fate of synthetic and organic life in the galaxy. The Reaper War is brought to an end, but the cost is immense, and the conclusion reflects one of the series' central themes: that leadership, sacrifice, and choice shape the future of the entire galaxy.</p>
        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p>Mass Effect 3 has undoubtedly the best gameplay in the series. It is fast paced, intense, and perfectly reflects the urgency of the game's events. Weapons are fast and deadly, enemies are smart and coordinated, and abilites are stronger than ever. Additionally, your class plays a much larger role in gameplay as there are now class-specific animations for certain attacks, you can combo certain abilities with your squadmates', and some enemies now have specific resistances.</p>
        <p>This game has the most weighted choices in the entire series. Shepard now carries the weight of the entire galaxy on his shoulders. Entire species' fates lie in his hands. Each choice you make directly affects who lives and dies. Think long and hard before making decisions in this game.</p>
        <p>Mass Effect 3 has many fun and interesting things to do other than the daily grind of reaper-slaying. On the Citadel, you can have an apartment, you can go to an arcade or casino, you can hang out with your squadmates, you can try to break records in a combat arena, or you can peruse the various shops to find interesting trinkets and souveniers to decorate your captains' cabin. Your armor is also highly customizable in this game, allowing you to edit each individual piece and choose from various colors and textures to get the look you want.</p>
        <h3>World</h3>
        <p>This game does a phenomenal job of portraying the realities of war. Refugees flood the Citadel, memorials are painted on walls, cities that were once lively now lie in ruin and silence. This game offers many side-quests and character interactions that allow you to both help people through problems, and allow you to gain a glimpse into the lives of the game's citizens. Worlds feel truly alive in this game, and sometimes even reflect the outcomes of your actions.</p>
